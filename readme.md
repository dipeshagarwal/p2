Description of the project:  I have developed a xkcd Style Password Generator which generates passwords consisting from common words. Such words are hard to guess (even by brute force), but easy to remember, making them interesting password choices.
                             Challenges faced: I have used POST and not GET because i am not able to get result in GET method, i will try using GET method again.
